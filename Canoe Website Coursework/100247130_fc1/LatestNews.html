		<h2 id="news1" class="id">Become a Personal Performance Awards Provider</h2>
		<p> Canary Canoe are pleased to announce that every Instructor, Coach, Leader, Raft Guide and Bell Boat 
		Helm will be able to deliver the NEW Personal Performance Awards, providing greater access for the 
		paddling community.</p>
		<p> All Providers will need to complete the Provider eLearning package before delivering the 
		Personal Performance Awards. This online package can be accessed in your own time, reducing the need 
		for travel, making this a more cost-effective route for all Providers. The eLearning takes approximately 
		an hour to complete.</p>
		<p> The provider eLearning was useful to gain the information about the new awards and allowed me to 
		have my questions answered with the added links and support videos. </p>

		as well as the first Paddlesport Instructor Provider Orientation, run by Lianne Diane. The first providers 
		to be oriented were Jen Cleck of Los Angeles, Don Cheyette of Chicago and Andrea Knepper from New York.</p>
		<p>Lennie Theodore presented the Canary Canoe update, with a great response to everything coming from 
		Canary Canoe.</p>
